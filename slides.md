## 1. Rewards for **any** content

you can get rewards for any type of content you can share
- posts
- video stream (e.g. https://zap.stream)
- music album (e.g. https://wavlake.com)
- video (e.g. https://flare.pub)
- longreads (e.g. https://stacker.news)

<v-click>
<p class="absolute bottom-100px">even rewards for replies and engagement with fans </p>

<p style="color:gray" class="absolute top-30px">2. creation motivation</p>

# A continuous stream of rewards provides... 

- **attention**: dopamine hits that make you feel appreciated
- **feedback**: figuring out what content your audience values most
- **motivation**:  an incentive to keep sharing higher quality posts

<v-click>
<h4 class="absolute bottom-75px">turning a virtual "likes" into sats with monetary value,<br/> independent of platform ad revenue, <br/><b>amplifies</b> these feelings</h4>
</v-click>

<p style="color:gray" class="absolute top-30px">3. reciprocity</p>

# **Reciprocity** is a powerful tool of influence, <br/>because it is based on the principle of **fairness**.
## --Robert Cialdini (from Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion)

<v-click>
<h4 class="absolute bottom-75px">this fairness works both ways, from the audience but also from creators: <br/>for example by giving back to other creators,<br/>or by producing more valueable content for the audience</h4>

# rewards can be split among collaborators, and instantly settled on each payment

<p style="color:gray" class="absolute top-30px">4. split pay settlement of commissions</p>

<v-click>
<h4 class="absolute bottom-50px">saves time in administration, <br/>is transparent, and decreases barriers<br/>to include more contributors</h4>

<p style="color:gray" class="absolute top-30px">5. content &amp; following portability</p>

- You own your content, no matter what app.
- You broadcast your content to any server. 
- Your followers list cannot be censored 
- Your followers list is consistent in all apps
- Your identity is consistent in all apps

<v-click>
<h4 class="absolute bottom-50px">having followers easily discover (and reward)<br/>your content across apps motivates creation</h4>
